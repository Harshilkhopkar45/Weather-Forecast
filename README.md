The Weather Forecast Website is a responsive web application that offers real-time weather information based on user-provided city names. 
In today’s fast-paced world, quick access to accurate weather updates is essential for planning daily activities. 
This project leverages the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple, yet effective tool for displaying current weather conditions. 
By retrieving live data from a weather API, users can easily check temperature, humidity, and other weather metrics in real time. 
The project aims to provide users with a seamless and reliable source of weather updates in a modern, accessible format.



System requirements:-
-> Clientside Technologies
  1. HTML- For building the layout and elements of the weather forecast interface.
  2. CSS - For styling and ensuring a visually appealing design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
  3. Javascript- For processing user input, fetching data from the WeatherAPI.Com , and dynamically updating the displayed weather information.(Inside html file)

-> API Integration:- I have used weatherapi.com for free api(weatherapi.com will give you immediate free api activated but it will be working for 15 days only then you have to create api again or pay for api continuation. ) 
but you can also use openweathermap.org( In openweathermap.org , you have to wait 3-4 hours to get api activated ,if not activated even after waiting for 3-4 hours. Create another api using another gamil id or write mail to openwearther map.org)
